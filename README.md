As a programming course trainer. This repo contains a curated selection of questions and exercises that I have used in teaching the essentials of Java programming. Here, you will find materials focusing on Java basics, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and string manipulations. Please note that this collection includes most, but not all, of the questions I have presented in the course. These resources are designed to enhance your understanding and help you master the foundational concepts necessary for proficient Java programming.
